# e-med-help

This is a web application created by Dimitriadis George, Kalfakakou Gratsiella, Bia Anastacia and Taxiarhis Andreas as a final project for the Coding Bootcamp 9 part-time Java class. The idea of a telemedicine application came to us prior to the COVID-19 pandemic as an application which its basic purpose is to help unable or lonely individuals who need medical help or assistance ... Also, people who live in remote places in our country can get instant medical advice. It also can be used from anyone avoiding overcrowding to the hospitals for no life-threatening reasons .. this application consists of 4 basic functions 1)VideoConference with the doctor 2)the doctor can fill a prescription and send it directly to a pharmacist 3)The pharmacist executes the prescription and notifies the patient for the amount which the patient must pay
4)the payment is executed through the Paypal system by the patient

**********************IMPORTANT***************************

The application is still in progress due to some missing functionality. Soon it will be completed...
